#####*“Culture eats strategy for breakfast.”*{::}
\- Peter Drucker

A well crafted and thought provoking soundbite. But what does it actually mean?
The quote, attributed to management guru Peter Drucker, was introduced to us on the first lesson of R9 Accelerator. It highlights that culture is a powerful and important force in all organisations, from startups, to Government agencies, to large corporations. In our context, it conveys the message that R9 teams should focus on building a great team culture.
Team culture will be the key element of our success.

Our following three lessons focussed on Agile and Lean methods and sales plans.
Isn’t that strategy? Shouldn’t we be focussing on team culture?

By defining the two terms, ‘Strategy’ and ‘Culture’ it becomes apparent it’s not one or the other, it’s both that matter. Strategy provides the focus and objectives.  
Culture is the capabilities, attitudes and behaviours of the organisation. Thus culture is used to deliver on the strategy.

Culture and strategy interact, and ideally they are mutually reinforcing.
Therefore the key focus for R9 Accelerator teams and all organisations should be - build an awesome culture first, then craft a strategy to match. Culture will help teams get through highs and lows of a journey of unknowns, and the strategies will support focus and direction.

So perhaps the quote shouldn’t be about what eats what, instead its:
