##### Did Peter Drucker actually say "culture eats strategy for breakfast" - and if so, where/when?

The origin of the quote appears to be Mark Fields, at Ford Motor Company, in 2006, who attributed it to Peter Drucker, although I have not found that exact quote by him.
It is certainly the sort of thing Peter Drucker might have said, but I haven't been able to source the quote, and neither has anyone else.

Peter Drucker often argued that a companies culture would trump any attempt to create a strategy that was incompatible with it's culture. Drucker did say Company cultures are like country cultures. Never try to change one. Try, instead, to work with what you’ve got.”
