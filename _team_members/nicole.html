  Nicole graduated with degrees in law and politics and then went on to work as a test consultant. Her
  test consultant experience was cross-functional: business analysis, consulting with business users,
  applying business logic in a technical domain, and test planning and execution.

  Within a year of being at her first employer, Nicole took up positions as a mentor, a learning group
  committee member and a facilitator for Lean Practice discussions. Prior to Assurity, she was a team
  lead for Ignite Consulting and a New Zealand delegate for the Aotearoa Youth Leadership Institute.

  Nicole was involved in setting up one of the first Aotearoa Code Clubs in Wellington, which teaches
  young children how to code. She also inspired other colleagues to join her in volunteering at the
  Club, which was so successful that many schools asked for another run of the program.
